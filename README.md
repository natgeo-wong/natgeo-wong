Hi everyone! I'm a Postdoc working under Professor [Sara Shamekh](https://sshamekh.com/) studying the different phases of convection using ARM and satellite observational data. I am also interested in studying tropical island climatology using climate models of varying complexities. I mostly work in #JuliaLang, and most of the code repositories of my projects can be found here as well.
