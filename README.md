Hi everyone! I'm a Graduate Student working under Professor [Kuang Zhiming](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kuang/) studying all things related to tropical climatology and meteorology using both observational data and (eventually) climate models of varying complexities. I mostly work in #JuliaLang, and most of the code repositories of my projects can be found here as well, with organization courtesy of the [DrWatson.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl) package!

Status of Projects and Package Repositories:
* **Julia Packages**
  * **Actively Maintained:** `ClimateSatellite.jl`, `ClimateERA.jl`, `GeoRegions.jl`, `SAMTools.jl`
  * **Developement Paused:** `IscaTools.jl`, `GillMatsuno.jl`, `ClimateGNSS.jl`
  * **Upcoming:** `ClimateReanalysis.jl` (combination of `ClimateERA.jl` with other reanalysis (i.e. NCEP and MERRA), unless someone gets to this first HAHA)
  
* **Project Code Repositories:**
  * **Actively Maintained:** MaritimeContPWV, PiPWV, DiConv
  * **Developement Paused:** I3C2M1, MonsoonTilt
